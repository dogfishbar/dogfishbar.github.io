## UPD/Academic Advising Notes

These are Bob Muller's notes on academic advising computer science students at BC. Most of the notes relate to the job of undergraduate program director but plain old academic advisors and students can find useful information too.

If you know of some advising arcana that isn't on this list but should be on this list, please let me know.

## CS Courses Abroad

#### Student Procedure

1. Find several courses that you're interested in taking, you'll need backups; 

2. Retrieve an [OIP Degree Audit Course Substitution Form For Study Abroad](https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/offices/stserv/pdf/degreeauditsubform_OIP.pdf);

3. Make an appointment with CS UPD to get the courses approved **before you go**. You'll need: 

   1. course titles and descriptions;
   2. appropriate syllabi.

   Once the courses are approved, fill out the form and get CS UPD to sign it.

4. Take the signed form to Student Services;

5. OIP will take care of getting transcripts back to Student Services.

#### Policies, Notes etc

- There is no limit on number of accepted credits — students taking courses abroad are paying BC tuition;
- most departments accept no more than 2 courses fulfilling major requirements from abroad but the CS dept. policy is to accept up to 3;
- major requirement coverage up to department;
- Kate Lowrie suggested students take 2000-level elective abroad.

## Summer Courses

#### Student Procedure

1. Find the course that you're interested in taking;

2. Retrieve a [Course Approval Form](https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/offices/stserv/academic/pdf/courseapproval.pdf); 

3. Make an appointment with CS UPD to get the course approved **before you take the course**. You'll need:

   1. course title & description; 
   2. a syllabus.

   Once the courses are approved, fill out the form and get CS UPD to sign it.

4. Take the signed form to Dean's office in Stokes Hall;

5. When course is completed, the **student is responsible** for getting transcripts sent from school offering summer course back to Student Services.

#### Policies etc

- Students with no credit deficiencies cannot count summer credit hours toward the total number of credits needed to graduate;
- Summer courses can fullfil major requirements but they're treated like AP credits: the student is required to take some other CS course to fill in
- **From Rebecca Schmitz in A&S**: If a student takes a CS course in the summer and you approve it to count for a particular course in the major, say, Computer Systems, that course will be put on the degree audit as fulfilling that requirement for the major. The student does not get the letter grade factored into the major GPA or count for credit but if you approve it, then it is one less class they have to take to complete the major. Some students take these courses "for enrichment" because they do not have enough space in the academic year to take all the courses needed to fulfill the degree requirements. Maybe they got a late start as a CS BS major and need to take summer courses to complete the major but don't have credit deficiencies. The only difference for a student who has a credit deficiency is that the grade *would be* factored into the major and cumulative GPA and the *credits would count* towards the 120 needed to graduate. So, if they took the same course, they both will have fulfilled that requirement for the major and will not need to take an extra course.

## Curricular Practical Training

International students may have visa issues that require them to complete a CPT internship with an outside organization or agency that requires a Boston College connection as a condition for offering the internship. There are two one-credit courses for this purpose UNAS 2250 and CSCI 1190. 

+ The credit received through the CPT internship cannot be applied to the credits required for completing the major or minor;
+ Only one CPT credit will be counted toward the 120 required for graduation;

+ The internship is graded on a pass/fail basis.

A student who wishes to enroll in a CPT internship is required to 

1. complete an approval form that can be obtained in the Dean's Office of the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences. 
2. The form must be signed by 
   1. the student's supervisor in the organization or agency providing the internship and by
   2. the Department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies.
3. After the form is signed, it should be sent to the student's class dean in Stokes.
4. At the end of the internship, the supervisor of the internship at the outside organization or agency must provide an evaluation to the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

+ **UNAS 2250 Internship** (1 credit) is the generic university course for a CPT *or*

+ **CSCI 1190 Computer Science Internship** (1 credit)

This one-credit course is available for any student or who wishes to complete an internship with an organization that requires a Boston College connection as a condition for offering the internship opportunity. 

A student who wishes to enroll in CSCI 1190 is required to complete an approval form that can be obtained in the Dean's Office of the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences. The form must be signed by the student's supervisor in the organization or agency providing the internship and also by the Department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies. After it is signed, it should be sent to the student's class dean. At the end of the internship, the organization supervisor must provide an evaluation to the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

## Misc

1. **Courses Prior to BC**: Courses prior to BC, either in HS or at another pre-transfer school are handled by the office of **Transfer Admissions**;
2. **Courses fulfilling more than one requirement**:
   - For the core: all double-counting courses are explicitly identified as such in the university catalog;
   - For major+major or major+minor: university rules allow only **one** course to count twice. Note that this does not  apply to fulfilling *co-requisites*, such as Calculus 2.
3. **AP Math & Math co-reqs**:
   - **BA**: a 4 or a 5 on either the AP BC or AB exams satisfy the CS BA calculus co-requisite. No replacement course is needed, use a **course substitution form**.
   - **BS**: we require either MATH1103 (spring) or MATH1105 (fall). These courses cover sequences and series, which are not covered in the AP BA classes. So, math dept. recommends only a 4 or 5 on the AP BC exam satisfy the calculus co-req for the BS.
4. **AP Science & BS Science Component:** (from Kate)
   - We followed the corresponding science department requirement.  As a practical matter, AP scores don't exempt a student from a lab in any applicable science.  
   - We accepted AP science exam for the 3-credit elective for the BS if the subject of the AP exam doesn't **overlap** (e.g., if you get a 5 on the physics AP, then take physics with a lab, you can't use that AP to get out of the science elective because its the same subject).
5. **Off-campus Internships for International Students — CPT** vs **OPT**: *Curricular Practical Training* vs *Optional Practical Training*. These are two options for off-campus internship work for international students. The former is used when a dept. requires an internship or otherwise confers academic credit for an internship. The CS dept. doesn't require or confer such credit so international students want to do off-campus internships should talk with the office of international students about an OPT. OPTs have limits established by the US state department.
6. **Students who want to enroll in 6th class**: 
   1. Must have GPA > 3.0; 
   2. can't register for 6th course until after first day of class.
7. **CS Course Substitutions**:

   1. *MATH 2216 Introduction to Abstract Math* or a reasonable *discrete math* course ala *Rosen* for *CSCI 2243 Logic & Computation*;
   2. *MATH 4426 Probability* (i.e., any calculus-based probability course) for *CSCI 2244 Randomness & Computation*. But NB **students who are using a probability course in lieu of R&C CANNOT also use the probability course as the 3000+ elective for the Math Component of the BS. This wouldn't preclude them from double-counting it if they're also a math major. **
8. **Summer Advising**: The Advising Center is always looking for people to help with freshman advising over the summer. Pays ~$650 per session.
9. **Pass/Fail**: Students can take one non-major pass/fail course in a semester. **Open Question**: how about co-reqs such as Calc 2?
10.

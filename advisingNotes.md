Dear Maira,

Congrats on taking over the role of Undergraduate Program Director in Comp. Sci. It's a big job, after all, undergraduate programs are all that we have. This document summarizes what I know about the job and includes some contact information for you. **Please feel free to check in with me for anything that you might be unsure of, I'll be happy to assist.** Once you get up and running, you'll begin to help shape the programs and help them evolve to meet student needs. I think you're going to be great at this job and I'm excited for you.

You shadowed me in May, I assume that you still want me to shadow you in June. Happy to do it if that would be helpful for you.

Best,

Bob Muller

I'll be contacting a number of people to let them know of the change-over, I'll cc you on all of those.

---

#### Overview of Role

The primary responsibilities of the job include overseeing the undergraduate degree programs in computer science and issues that arise relating to students enrolled in those programs or considering enrollment in those programs. The former includes ensuring that the specification of the course requirements for the programs are up to date and working as the department wishes. (See the discussion of the University Catalog below.) The latter includes evaluation of course substitution requests, courses taken at other institutions, whether by transfer or summer enrollment, and courses taken abroad.

The undergraduate program director holds a once a year orientation meeting with new majors and minors. The orientation meeting is often held with selected faculty and junior and senior majors. The UPD is also responsible for working with Student Services ensure that graduating students have met the degree requirements.

The undergraduate program director is responsible for liaising with administrators in other departments, with Student Services, with the Dean's office and with the Advising Center. Among these responsibilities include annual review of the course catalog and of the degree audits. The undergraduate program director also works with the chair to manage the selection of honors designations for CS majors including Sophomore Scholars, Scholars of the College (juniors) as well as the annual Neuhauser Award.

> Heads up: One of the main jobs of the UPD is to say "No". This includes "no's" to students requesting exemption from some requirement or another and especially to folks in other departments, such as Information Systems, who periodically request that their course such-and-such should be cross-listed with CS or that course such-and-such should count for CS1 or count as a CS elective. If you say "no", it's not hard to change it later to a "maybe" or a "yes". But if you say "yes", it's very difficult to reverse course. And moreover, word about special deals with students spreads like wild-fire. So "No" or "Sorry, we can't do that", I said them all the time.
>
> Having said that, I will almost always say "Yes" and bend our rules for students experiencing special challenges such as health problems.

### Working with CS Admin

+ You'll work closely with Howard on a variety of different issues. 

+ You'll work with Mary mostly around issues related to her administrative privileges:

  + students wanting to change their majors or minors;

  + students who want to enroll in a give course or be added to a wait-list for a course. Note that Howard and Mary have managed enrollment in CS courses and waiting lists. As UPD, you'll get a lot of requests for assistance on this front. I usually refer those to Howard and/or Mary. 

    > **Heads up: Unless the UPD is going to get involved with enrollment management, it would be better if the information on the CS website routed these enrollment/override requests directly to the person who can resolve the requests rather than routing them through the UPD who simply re-routes them.**

+ There will be an occasional request by a HS student +/- parents to meet with someone in the dept. These are usually handled by the UPD or Howard.

+ Mary can help if you need a meeting space for one reason or another.

+ You'll work with Phil around issues relating to coordination between the CS material in the university catalog and the department website. 

  > **The dept. website obviously needs a makeover but you're going to be sufficiently busy with other things, that I would caution you against taking on that project.**

### Working with Student Services and the Registrar's Office

The main point of contact in the Registrar's office is **Whitney Hoyle**. 

+ **Whitney Hoyle,** *Associate Registrar, Academic Records/Grading/Commencement*,  [whitney.hoyle@bc.edu](mailto:whitney.hoyle@bc.edu), 2-2840
+ **Mary French,** *University Registrar,* [mary.french@bc.edu](mailto:mary.french@bc.edu), 2-4943
+ **Ursula DellaPorta,** *Associate Registrar, Curriculum Management/Degree Audit,* [ursula.dellaporta@bc.edu](mailto:ursula.dellaporta@bc.edu), 2-4739
+ **TBD (contact Whitney Hoyle),** *Assistant Registrar, Transfer Articulation/Cross-Registration/Internal Academic Data*
+ **Joshua Bocher,** *Communications Specialist, Office of Student Services,* [joshua.bocher@bc.edu](mailto:joshua.bocher@bc.edu), 2-1494

From time to time, someone from the registrar's office will request a review of CS degree audits to make sure they're working correctly.

#### Student Services On-line Forms

The UPD workflow has been greatly improved since Student Services deployed their online ticketing system. The students now fill out electronic [forms](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/offices/student-services/registrar/academic-forms.html) on the Student Services site and the automated form manager will route a ticket to your email with a link to a page that will allow you to review the request and either approve it or not. The main forms that we use are:

+ **Degree Audit Course Substitution & Waiver Form**

+ **Course Pre-Approval Form** This is used for summer school courses. 

  > Heads up: It isn't clear to me whether or not this latter form is now also the form used by the [Office of International Programs](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/offices/office-of-international-programs.html) for students planning study abroad. I tried to check on this but they didn't get back to me.

#### The University Catalog

The University Catalog covers a lot of ground. The main pieces of information that you need to be concerned with relate to the university's [Academic Policies](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/mcas/undergraduate/advising/academic-policies.html) and to the description of the computer science programs. 

> The Academic Policies website is very handy, I recommend a bookmark.

The official specifications of our degree programs are laid out in [our little corner of the university catalog](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/academics/sites/university-catalog/undergraduate/mcas/computer-science.html). As I understand it, the university is no longer publishing a hardcopy of the catalog, this on-line version is what we are obligated to implement. Of course there are several other sources of information about our programs, but this is the official one. Notable among these other sources is the most used one: our (outdated) department website. It's important to try to keep the information on the website consistent with the catalog. From time to time, you'll get an email from a student asking about inconsistencies. So take note of those and remove the inconsistencies.

Round about December, someone from Student Services (e.g., Josh Bocher) will send you an email along the following lines:

```
Dear Bob,

Please see your attached catalog content for the 2021â€“2022 catalog.

If you have any changes, please make the updates in the Word document using track changes. You can send back the updated document to this e-mail address (catalog@bc.edu).

The deadlines are as follows:
January 27, 2021: Last date for course description changes in Curriculum Management for summer 2021 and fall 2021.
February 12, 2021: Last date for all undergraduate catalog changes.

If there are no changes, please let us know that no revisions are necessary.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to respond directly to this e-mail with them.

Sincerely,
Joshua Bocher
Communications and Course Information Specialist
Office of Student Services
```

This should trigger a review of both the catalog information and the web site information.

> Heads up: As I understand it, the catalog includes course descriptions only for courses offered in the year covered by the catalog edition. Somewhere else in the BC system there is a database of *all* CS courses on the books. Some of these are discontinued, etc. I believe that Mary knows where to find this full course description database. There is probably an EagleApps portal to this now.
>
> Also heads up: As you probably know, **the old UIS system didn't enforce course prereqs. The new EagleApps system has the capability to enforce prereqs but that capability is currently disabled**. Ursula DellaPorta is in charge of this.

### Working with the MCAS Dean's Office

You'll have a once-a-semester luncheon with Greg Kalscheur and all of the other undergraduate program directors in MCAS. Otherwise, there isn't much interaction with Greg.

#### MCAS Class Associate Deans

MCAS has Associate Deans who are assigned cohorts of students by graduation year. When problems crop up, it's often reasonable to confer with the student's class dean or refer the student to their class dean.

+ **Joseph B. Desciak** Dean for Freshmen, **Director, Academic Advising Ctr.**, Stokes 140S, [joseph.desciak@bc.edu](mailto:joseph.desciak@bc.edu), 2-9259
+ **Treseanne Ainsworth** Dean for Sophomores, Stokes S171, [treseanne.ainsworth@bc.edu](mailto:treseanne.ainsworth@bc.edu), 2-2800
+ **Rafael Luna** Dean for Juniors, [rafael.luna@bc.edu](mailto:rafael.luna@bc.edu), 2-2800
+ **Michael Martin** Dean for Seniors, Stokes 140S, [michael.martin.2@bc.edu](mailto:michael.martin.2@bc.edu), 2-2309

> When I'm confused about something I sometimes send a friendly email to [casdean](mailto:casdean@bc.edu).

#### University Awards & Recognition

The main items here are

+ Sophomore Scholars
+ Dean's Scholars (juniors)
+ The John J. Neuhauser Award for Computer Science for top senior

Round about March, you'll receive something along the following lines:

```
James Teixeira <teixeijb@bc.edu>
Wed, Mar 31, 2:40 PM
to Robert, Howard

Dear Professors and Colleagues, 

Please see the attached letter from Dean Kalscheur regarding your department's Dean's and Sophomore Scholar award recipients. Thank you again for your help in identifying these scholars.
...
--
James Teixeira
Assistant Director, Advising Operations
```

This should trigger an email from you (or Howard) to faculty colleagues to discuss the merits of the various candidates. Don't be shy about nominating a healthy number of CS students.

### Working with the Advising Center

As I understand it, undergraduate advising takes place in 3 phases:

1. Entering first-year students are assigned a preliminary advisor during summer orientation;
2. On enrollment in the fall, first-year students are assigned a one-year advisor from a university-wide pool of advisors;
3. Second-year students are assigned an advisor in the department of their declared major. In theory, these are the advisors continuing to the completion of that major.

As you can see above, First-year Dean Joe Desciak heads up the Advising Center. Other people in the Advising Center that I cross paths with include:

+ **Joseph B. Desciak**, *Associate Dean*, *Director*, [joseph.desciak@bc.edu](mailto:joseph.desciak@bc.edu)

+ **Rebecca Schmitz**, *Associate Director*, [rebecca.schmitz@bc.edu](mailto:rebecca.schmitz@bc.edu)

+ **Erin Curley**, *Assistant Director*, Pre-Health Program, [e.oleary@bc.edu](mailto:e.oleary@bc.edu), [premed@bc.edu](mailto:premed@bc.edu)

+ **Helen Ha**, *Assistant Directory*, [helen.ha@bc.edu](mailto:helen.ha@bc.edu)

+ **Ryan Mulderrig**, *Assistant Director*, [ryan.mulderrig@bc.edu](mailto:ryan.mulderrig@bc.edu)

+ **James Teixeira**, *Assistant Director*, Academic Operations, [james.teixeira@bc.edu](mailto:james.teixeira@bc.edu)

Sometime in early May, you'll receive an email requesting CS information updates for summer advising:

```
Good afternoon,

We in the Academic Advising Center are currently planning for the summer advising and registration season. ...

We are updating the information we provide to summer & pre-major advisors. Your department has included materials in the past and we wanted to give you the chance to do so again.  If there are any significant departmental or curricular changes that summer advisors should know, please send these changes ... along by Monday, May 24th. 

Ryan Mulderrig
Assistant Director - Academic Advising
```

A few notes:

+ When I need information related to advising, I sometimes email [aac@bc.edu](mailto:aac@bc.edu).

+ The Advising Center maintains an on-line Advising Database. The Advising Database is very handy because it gives you lots of information about students enrolled in CS programs. One needs a special account to get access. I will contact Ryan Mulderrig about this for you.

> **Heads up: Who assigns CS faculty advisors for CS majors who need an advisor? I don't know. (!) I believe that my predecessor Kate Lowrie took care of this when she was UPD. I haven't done it consistently. Sometimes it has been done by Ryan Mulderigg and I think sometimes by Howard and/or Mary. **
>
> **Ownership of this task is worth a conversation with Howard and Mary. Should the UPD do it? With now more than 500 majors, the CS UPD is already super busy. But so is Howard.** 


#### Office of International Programs & CS Courses Abroad

This office manages semesters abroad. I've just been too busy to deal with these folks. They recently circulated an email talking up "engagement" with departments and wanting to meet with all UPDs to get our perspectives on foreign schools. I didn't have either time or knowledge for this so I declined to meet with them. (Much to their chagrin.)

**Student Procedure for Selecting Abroad Classes**

1. Find several courses that you're interested in taking, you'll need backups; 

3. Make an appointment with CS UPD to get the courses approved *before you go*. You'll need: 

   1. course titles and descriptions;
   2. appropriate syllabi.

   Once the courses are approved, fill out and submit a Course Pre-Approval Form (I believe it's the one on the Student Services site.)

5. OIP will take care of getting course transcripts back to Student Services.

**Policies, Notes etc**

- There is no limit on number of abroad credits accepted â€” students taking courses abroad are paying BC tuition;
- most departments accept no more than 2 courses fulfilling major requirements from abroad but the CS dept. policy has been to accept up to 3;
- major requirement coverage is up to department, I allowed it.
- Kate Lowrie suggested that BA students should take their 2000-level elective abroad.

---

## Summer Courses

**Student Procedure for Selecting Summer Courses**

1. Find the course(s) that you're interested in taking;

3. Make an appointment with CS UPD to get the course approved *before taking the course*. You'll need:

   1. course title & description; 
   2. a syllabus.

   Once the courses are approved by the CS UPD, fill out and submit a Course Pre-Approval Form;

5. When the course is completed, **the student is responsible for getting transcripts sent from the school offering the summer course back to Student Services at BC**.

**Policies etc**

- Students with no credit deficiencies cannot count summer credit hours toward the total number of credits needed to graduate;
- Summer courses can fullfil major requirements but they're treated like AP credits: the student is required to take some other CS course to fill in
- **From Rebecca Schmitz in the Advising Ctr**: If a student takes a CS course in the summer and you approve it to count for a particular course in the major, say, Computer Systems, that course will be put on the degree audit as fulfilling that requirement for the major. The student does not get the letter grade factored into the major GPA or count for credit but if you approve it, then it is one less class they have to take to complete the major. Some students take these courses "for enrichment" because they do not have enough space in the academic year to take all the courses needed to fulfill the degree requirements. Maybe they got a late start as a CS BS major and need to take summer courses to complete the major but don't have credit deficiencies. The only difference for a student who has a credit deficiency is that the grade *would be* factored into the major and cumulative GPA and the *credits would count* towards the 120 needed to graduate. So, if they took the same course, they both will have fulfilled that requirement for the major and will not need to take an extra course.

### Practical Training Internships

The department has a longstanding policy prohibiting internships for academic credit. However, due to immigration issues, we tweaked that policy a few years ago to allow for one-credit Optional Practical Training (OPT) and Curricular Practical Training (CPT) internships. See the [Office of International Programs](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/offices/office-of-international-students-and-scholars/maintain/students.html) for details.

### Deals that We've Made and things to Watch out For

Sometimes a course will pop up in some other department that seems like a reasonable opportunity for our students. For example, in 2020-2021, we accepted a quantum computing course in the Physics Dept. as a substitute for a 3000+-CSCI elective. You have to evaluate these for technical depth as they come along. Don't be shy about asking colleagues for their perspectives.

Sometimes we'll make a deal with another department in response to the appearance of an opportunity for our students or in response to a resource problem that we have. Sometimes the deal involves formally cross-listing a course and sometimes it involves informally accepting a course as a substitute for a CSCI elective. This has happened recently in response to our own staff shortages and consequent 3000-level elective shortages. We've been accepting the following:

+ We've been allowing substitution of [ECON338201 Introduction to Computational Investing](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/academics/sites/university-catalog/courses/arts-sciences/economics.html#) (Tzuo Han Law), as a 2000-level CSCI elective. This has been very helpful for CS BA majors double-majoring in ECON.
+ We've been allowing substitution of [ECON338901 Machine Learning for Economics](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/academics/sites/university-catalog/courses/arts-sciences/economics.html#), (Anatoly Arlashin), as a 3000-level CSCI elective. This has been helpful for CS + ECON double majors.
+ We've been cross-listing Josh Hartshorne's psychology course **PSYC 5564 Computational Models of Cognition**.This course is offered only occasionally.

> Heads up: As of Spring 2021 Machine Learning courses have cropped up in 3 other departments: Information Systems, Math, and Economics. These are in addition to and with no coordination with our own ML course. I have not been allowing substitutions for the ISYS ML course. The status of the MATH course is an open question.

#### Things to Watch out For

The Information Systems Dept. wants to teach more computer science. I have steadfastly followed the Bob Signorile rule: we do not allow substitutions for any ISYS course for any CSCI course. This has been a great policy and I strongly recommend the Signorile rule.

> Heads up: There is an exception here: CSCI 2257 Database Systems and Applications has been cross-listed with ISYS 2257 for two decades. The status of this course now seems to be in question. You should probably have a discussion around this with Howard.

Another thing to watch out for is when some faculty member in another department starts up a project of some kind that involves an App of some kind. In the past, this has led to poorly conceived **Reading in Computer Science (CSCI 4911)** courses for CS majors where the "Reading" part translates to "please write a program for my project that does X". Because of these situations, we've placed **a cap of one** on the number of 4000-level CSCI courses that count as 3000+ CSCI electives.

---

## Miscellaneous Items

1. **27/15** It's worth remembering that university policy specifies that a student needs at least 27 single-use credits to complete a major and at least 15 single-use credits to complete a minor. Beyond those numbers, students can double-count courses as they wish. Note that this does not  apply to fulfilling *co-requisites*, such as Calculus 2. That is, they can double-count any number of co-requisites.

2. The department has a longstanding tradition of leaving the 7-course CSCI core free of object-oriented programming methodology (especially inheritance). We adopted this tradition long before object-oriented programming started trending downward in industry. It has been a good policy that has served our students well. Students interested in OO methodology can take the 3000-level elective.

3. **Courses Prior to BC**: Courses taken prior to BC, either in HS or at another pre-transfer school are handled by the office of **Transfer Admissions**;

4. **AP Math & Math co-reqs**:
   - **BA**: a 4 or a 5 on either the AP BC or AB exams satisfy the CS BA calculus co-requisite. No replacement course is needed, use a **course substitution form**.
   - **BS**: we require either MATH1103 (spring) or MATH1105 (fall). These courses cover sequences and series, which are not covered in the AP BA classes. So, math dept. recommends only a 4 or 5 on the AP BC exam satisfy the calculus co-req for the BS.

5. **AP Science & BS Science Component:** (from Kate) We followed the corresponding science department requirement.  As a practical matter, AP scores don't exempt a student from a lab in any applicable science.  

6. **Students who want to enroll in 6th class**: 
   1. Must have GPA > 3.0; 
   2. can't register for 6th course until after the first day of class.

7. **CS Course Substitutions**:

   1. *MATH 2216 Introduction to Abstract Math* or a reasonable *discrete math* course ala *Rosen* for *CSCI 2243 Logic & Computation*;
   2. *MATH 4426 Probability* (i.e., any calculus-based probability course) for *CSCI 2244 Randomness & Computation*. But NB **students who are using a probability course as a substitute for Randomness and Computation CANNOT also use the probability course as the 3000+ elective for the Math Component of the BS. **

8. **Pass/Fail**: Students can take one non-major pass/fail course in a semester.

   > **Open Question**: how about co-reqs such as Calc 2?

<h3>Retrospective</h3>

Generally speaking, I've worked on the design and implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_value">call-by-value</a>
  and <i>mostly functional</i> programming languages, early on with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a>
and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> and later with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML">Standard ML</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml">OCaml</a> dialects
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Milner">Robin Milner</a>'s beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">ML programming language</a>. I was drawn to languages of this kind after I was introduced
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)#Historically_significant_dialects">LISP 1.5</a> in a wonderful class in programming
languages taught by a graduate student at Indiana University in the
summer of 1977.

My work has ranged from more theoretical aspects of programming languages
to concrete implementation-oriented issues that arise in optimizing
compilers.  From my perspective, I made two principal contributions.
</p>

<h3>Sorting Out LISP's Metalinguistic Power</h3>

Programming in LISP is incredibly fun! Symbolic expressions
(S-expressions) are the ultimate flexible recursive data structures,
immutability is the default and, since everything is an S-expression,
it's fairly easy to write meta-programs &#8211 programs that work on
the representations of other programs.

<br>

But something seems a little fishy &#8211 how can the form
<tt>(bobcat deer bear)</tt> be a <i>list</i> while the form
<tt>(find bobcat bobcats)</tt> is a <i>function call</i>?
This was the question put to me by 
<a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/wand/">Mitch Wand</a> 
early in 1988. I spent untold hours thinking about this puzzle.
The answer came to me in a flash one morning late in 1989.
There was a simple error in the original definition LISP.  The
error appears on page 15 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a>'s
seminal 1960 paper introducing LISP <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf">Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine</a>.
<img src="assets/mccarthyerror.png">
The error, highlighted above, was propogated into a derivative
dialects of LISP including Scheme and Racket.  Correcting the
error and tidying up the downstream consequences leads to a simpler
programming language but the metalinguistic power is lost.
</p>

<p>This problem and the related issues are explored in detail in
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=fElFp20AAAAJ&citation_for_view=fElFp20AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC">M-LISP: A representation-independent dialect of LISP with reduction semantics</a>. 
</p>
Among other things, this work taught me that both common knowledge
and really smart people are often wrong.

<h3>Type-Directed Compilation</h3>

  I worked on high-performance certifying compilers for higher-order
  typed programming languages such as Standard ML. I spent several
  years working as a founding member of the Church Project. Together
  with Robert Harper, I co-founded the ACM Types in Compilation (TIC)
  series of workshops. The TIC workshop series subsequently evolved
  into the ACM Types in Language Design and Implementation (TLDI). The
  last of these met in 2012.</p>

<h3>Retrospective</h3>

Generally speaking, I've worked on the design and implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_value">call-by-value</a>
  and <i>mostly functional</i> programming languages, early on with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a>
and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> and later with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML">Standard ML</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml">OCaml</a> dialects
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Milner">Robin Milner</a>'s beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">ML programming language</a>. I was drawn to languages of this kind after I was introduced
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)#Historically_significant_dialects">LISP 1.5</a> in a wonderful class on <i>programming
languages</i> taught by a graduate student at Indiana University in the
summer of 1977.  Since then, my work has ranged from more theoretical aspects of programming languages
to concrete implementation-oriented issues that arise in optimizing
compilers.  From my perspective, I made two principal contributions
and one lesser one.
</p>

<h3>1. Sorting Out LISP's Metalinguistic Power</h3>

<p>This work was carried out as my PhD thesis at Boston University
under the direction of
<a href="https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/assaf-kfoury/">Assaf Kfoury</a>
with additional advising by
<a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/wand/">Mitch Wand</a>. It was
published in a 1992 TOPLAS article
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=fElFp20AAAAJ&citation_for_view=fElFp20AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC">M-LISP: A representation-independent dialect of LISP with reduction semantics</a>.
<br>
Programming in LISP is incredibly fun! Symbolic expressions
(S-expressions) are the ultimate flexible recursive data structures,
immutability is the default and, since everything is an S-expression,
it's fairly easy to write meta-programs &#8211 programs that work on
the representations of other programs.
<br>
But something seems a little fishy &#8211 how can the form
<tt>(bobcat deer bear)</tt> be a <i>list</i> while the form
<tt>(find bobcat bobcats)</tt> is a <i>function call</i>?  This was
the question put to me by Mitch Wand when I was a graduate student in
1987. I spent untold hours thinking about this puzzle.  The answer
came to me in a flash one morning in the summer of 1988 &#8211
<b>there is a simple error in the original definition LISP</b>. (!)
The error appears on page 15 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a>'s
seminal 1960 paper introducing LISP: <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf">Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine</a>.
<img src="assets/mccarthyerror.png">
The error, highlighted above, was subsequently propagated into all derivative
dialects of LISP including Scheme and Racket.  Correcting the
error and tidying up the downstream consequences leads to a simpler
programming language but the metalinguistic power is lost.  The
details are laid out in the aforementioned TOPLAS article.
</p>

Among other things, this work taught me a healthy skepticism
of common knowledge.

<h3>2. Type-Directed Compilation</h3>

<p>This work was carried out during my tenure as an Assistant
  Professor at Boston College.  It was published in a number of
  articles, most notably in a 2000 JFP article
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=fElFp20AAAAJ&citation_for_view=fElFp20AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC">A calculus with polymorphic and polyvariant flow types</a>, joint with Joe Wells, Lyn Turbak
  and Allyn Dimock.
</p>
<p>Sometime in 1995 I attended a talk by
<a href="http://trevorjim.com/">Trevor Jim</a> on
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/237721.237728">principal typings</a>.
Subsequent conversations with Assaf Kfoury,
<a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/">Joe Wells</a> and
<a href="https://cs.wellesley.edu/~fturbak/">Lyn Turbak</a> led to the
establishment of the Church Project, a joint research project between
Boston University, Wellesley College and Boston College. The central
focus of the Church Project was the design and development of a typed
intermediate language (TIL) that might be used in a reliable
optimizing compiler for ML-like programming languages. The advantage
of a <i>typed</i> IL over an untyped one is that the compiler can
type-check the intermediate representation (IR) after transformation
steps.  The particular TIL developed in the Church Project used
interesection and union types together with flow labels. This enabled
the compiler to track the flow of values from their creation points to
their consumption sites
and to choose data representations in a safe and flexible way. For
example, the following snippet of code
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="assets/cil1.png" width=300></div>
<p>produces a 3-tuple as a value, using 3 principal functions <tt>k</tt>,
  <tt>g</tt> and <tt>h</tt>.  The example illustrates non-trivial flow
  of functions to various call sites. In the IR, the program is
  represented with both type and flow information.
</p>
<img src="assets/cil2.png">
<p>
  In the diagram, arrows represent flow. The function <tt>k</tt> can
flow to two different call sites, specifically call site 4 or call site
6. The function is represented as a <i>virtual 2-tuple</i>, allowing
  for the possibility of two different copies of <tt>k</tt>. The compiler
  can choose to reify the virtual 2-tuple into a real heap-allocated 2-tuple
  in the object code. This process is called <i>source splitting</i>.
</p>
<img src="assets/cil3.png">
<p>
  The type system also allows the compiler split sinks by reifying
  virtual case dispatches to real case dispatches in the object code.
  </p>
<img src="assets/cil4.png">
<p>
  I worked on high-performance certifying compilers for higher-order
  typed programming languages such as Standard ML. I spent several
years working as a founding member of the Church Project.

<br>
  Together with Robert Harper, I co-founded the ACM Types in
  Compilation (TIC) series of workshops. The TIC workshop series
  subsequently evolved into the ACM Types in Language Design and
  Implementation (TLDI) series of workshops. The last of these met in
  2012.</p>

<h3>2. Type-Directed Register Allocation</h3>

This was joint with
<a href="https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~tamtoft/">Torben Amtoft</a>, then
a postdoc working with the Church Project.  I would like to highlight
that <i>virtually all of the heavy lifting in this project was done by
Torben Amtoft.</i>  This work appeared in the proceedings the 2003
TLDI Workshop.  In retrospect, it probably should have been submitted
to PLDI or ICFP where it would have received a wider reading.</p>
